### ReScience (R)evolution

Four years ago, we launched ReScience, a new scientific journal aimed at
publishing the replication of existing computational research. Since ReScience
published its first article, things have been going steadily. We are still
alive, independent and without a budget. In the meantime, we have published
around 24 articles (mostly in computational neuroscience & computational
ecology) and the initial board has grown from around 10 to roughly 100 members
(editors and reviewers), we have advertised ReScience at several conferences
worldwide, gave some interviews, and published an article introducing ReScience
in PeerJ CS. Based on our experience at managing the journal during these four
years, we think that time is ripe for some changes.
